# Project Proposal

## Domain Background

* This project focuses on customer segmentation and marketing analytics using the DIAS dataset from Arvato Financial Solutions, which includes demographic and socio-economic data of individuals in Germany.

* Traditional marketing strategies are being enhanced by big data and advanced analytics. The DIAS dataset provides valuable information like age, gender, income, and purchasing behavior for this purpose.

* Machine learning can analyze the DIAS dataset to identify patterns and trends, helping companies tailor marketing efforts to different customer segments, leading to better customer satisfaction and loyalty.

* Research shows data-driven marketing strategies improve campaign effectiveness. For instance, Smith et al. (2018) found higher conversion rates and customer retention with data analytics-based segmentation. This project aims to apply similar techniques to the DIAS dataset.

* My interest in data science and its business applications motivates me to investigate this problem. Leveraging data to understand customer behavior can help companies make better decisions. This project allows me to apply my data analysis and machine learning skills to a real-world problem.

## Problem Statement

* The primary challenge is to identify distinct customer segments using the DIAS dataset from Arvato Financial Solutions. The objective is to utilize demographic and socio-economic data to develop targeted marketing strategies.
* Potential approaches include employing clustering algorithms and classification models.
* This problem is quantifiable, measurable, and repeatable. We can quantify customer segments and measure the success of targeted advertising through metrics like conversion rates and ROI (Return on Investment). The process can be repeated with similar datasets for consistent results.

## Solution Statement

* The solution involves applying clustering algorithms, such as K-means, and classification models to the DIAS dataset to identify distinct customer segments.
* The solution is applicable to the project scope as it utilizes demographic and socio-economic data to develop targeted marketing strategies, aligning with the data analysis techniques
* The solution is quantifiable through metrics such as silhouette score for clustering and accuracy for classification. It is measurable by evaluating model performance on a validation set and replicable by following the data preprocessing and modeling steps
* Target model: **Supervised Learning - Classification - Random Forest**
* Save the model: save as `'random_forest_model.pkl'` pickle file
    ```
    # Save the model using joblib
    joblib.dump(model, model_filename)
    ```
* Where the model will be implemented:
    * Environment: 
        1. Cloud-based environment as AWS, GCP, or Azure to ensure scalability, reliability, and accessibility
        2. Integration with Existing Systems: Web, Mobile or Business Software
    * Programming Language: Python
    * Create Prediction API:
        ```
        # Create a prediction API using Flask
        from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
        import joblib

        app = Flask(__name__)   

        # Load the trained model from the file
        loaded_model = joblib.load(model_filename)

        @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
        def predict():
            data = request.json
            prediction = loaded_model.predict(data)
            return jsonify({'prediction': prediction})

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            app.run(debug=True)
        ```

* The dataset will be used to develop targeted marketing strategies and identify distinct customer segments.
* The use of the dataset is appropriate as it provides valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences, enabling the development of more effective marketing strategies.

## Benchmark Model

* The benchmark model will be K-means clustering, which partitions data into K clusters based on feature similarity.

* K-means will be applied to the DIAS dataset to create initial customer segments, serving as a baseline.

* Performance will be evaluated using the silhouette score, indicating how well-defined the clusters are.

* This benchmark helps assess the effectiveness of more advanced models by comparing their results to K-means.

## Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances. Used for evaluating classification models.

* Precision: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. Used for evaluating classification models.

* Recall: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. Used for evaluating classification models.

* F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall. Used for evaluating classification models.
