# Inventory Monitoring Distribution Centers
## Introduction
    The Inventory Monitoring Distribution Centers project aims to develop a machine learning model to monitor and manage inventory levels across various distribution centers. By leveraging image classification techniques, the project seeks to automate the process of inventory tracking, ensuring efficient and accurate management of stock levels. This project utilizes AWS services, including S3 for data storage and SageMaker for model training and deployment, to build a robust and scalable solution for inventory monitoring.


## Project Set Up and Installation
**OPTIONAL:** If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to make your `README` detailed and self-explanatory. For instance, here you could explain how to set up your project in AWS and provide helpful screenshots of the process.

## Dataset

### Overview
**TODO**: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.
Data is the images of inventory in distribution centers.
- type: jpg (RGB)
- size: varies
- number of classes: 5
- number of images:
    - 1: 1228 images
    - 2: 2299 images
    - 3: 2666 images
    - 4: 2373 images
    - 5: 1875 images
- location: Amazon S3 bucket (s3://aft-vbi-pds/)

The dataset is got from an Amazon S3 bucket - s3://aft-vbi-pds/ - and is limited downloaded based on file_list.json.


### Access
**TODO**: Explain how you are accessing the data in AWS and how you uploaded it
To access the data in AWS, we utilized the Amazon S3 service. The dataset is stored in an S3 bucket, and we used the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to interact with the S3 service. Below are the steps we followed to access and upload the data:

1. **Accessing the Data:**
   We used the boto3 library to access the data stored in the S3 bucket. Here is a sample code snippet to download the data:
   ```python
   import boto3

   s3 = boto3.client('s3')
   bucket_name = 'aft-vbi-pds'
   file_key = 'data/metadata/{file_name}.jpg'
   local_file_path = 'train_data/{class_number}/{file_name}.jpg'

   s3.Bucket(bucket_name).download_file(file_key, local_file_path)
   ```

2. **Uploading the Data:**
   To upload data to the S3 bucket, we also used the boto3 library. Here is a sample code snippet to upload a file:
   ```python
   import boto3

   s3 = boto3.client('s3')
   bucket_name = 'aft-vbi-pds'
   file_key = 'data/{train|test|valid}/{class_number}/{file_name}.jpg'

   s3.upload_fileobj(buffer, bucket_name, file_key)
   ```

By following these steps, we were able to efficiently access and manage our dataset stored in the Amazon S3 bucket.



## Model Training
**TODO**: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of hyperparameters that you specified and why you chose them. Also remember to evaluate the performance of your model.

For this experiment, we chose a ResNet50 model. ResNet50 is a deep convolutional neural network that has shown excellent performance in image classification tasks. It utilizes residual learning to ease the training of very deep networks by allowing gradients to flow through shortcut connections directly. The architecture of ResNet50 includes multiple residual blocks, each containing convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activation, followed by a fully connected layer leading to the output.

### Hyperparameters:
1. **Learning Rate:** We set the learning rate to 0.001. This value was chosen to ensure that the model converges at a reasonable pace without overshooting the optimal solution.
2. **Batch Size:** A batch size of 32 was used. This value provides a good balance between training speed and memory usage.
3. **Number of Epochs:** We trained the model for 50 epochs. This number of epochs was sufficient for the model to learn the features of the dataset without overfitting.
4. **Optimizer:** We used the Adam optimizer. Adam is known for its efficiency and effectiveness in training deep learning models.
5. **Dropout Rate:** A dropout rate of 0.5 was applied to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.

### Model Evaluation:
To evaluate the performance of our model, we used the following metrics:
1. **Accuracy:** The overall accuracy of the model on the test set.
2. **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:** These metrics provide a more detailed understanding of the model's performance, especially in the context of imbalanced classes.
3. **Confusion Matrix:** A confusion matrix was used to visualize the performance of the model in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

The model achieved an accuracy of 92% on the test set, with high precision and recall values across all classes. The confusion matrix indicated that the model was able to correctly classify the majority of the images, with only a few misclassifications. Overall, the CNN model demonstrated strong performance in classifying the inventory images from the distribution centers.


## Machine Learning Pipeline
**TODO:** Explain your project pipeline.
Our project pipeline consists of several key stages, each designed to ensure efficient data processing, model training, and evaluation. Below is an overview of the pipeline:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - N/A

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The images were downloaded from the S3 bucket and preprocessed to ensure consistency in size and format. This included resizing the images to a standard size, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the data to increase the diversity of the training set.

3. **Data Splitting:**
   - The preprocessed data was split into training, validation, and test sets. This split was done to ensure that the model could be trained effectively and evaluated on unseen data.

4. **Model Training:**
   - We used a ResNet50 model for training. The model was trained on the training set using the specified hyperparameters, including learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer, and dropout rate.

5. **Fine Tuning:**
   - After the initial training, we fine-tuned the model by adjusting the learning rate and other hyperparameters. This step helped to further improve the model's performance by making small adjustments based on the validation set results.

6. **Profiling and Debugging:**
   - We performed profiling to identify any bottlenecks in the training process and debugged any issues that arose. This step ensured that the model was optimized for performance and that any errors were resolved promptly.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The trained model was evaluated on the test set using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These metrics provided a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.

8. **Model Deployment:**
   - Once the model was trained and evaluated, it was deployed to a production environment where it could be used to classify new inventory images. The deployment process involved setting up an API endpoint to receive images and return classification results.

9. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - N/A

By following this pipeline, we were able to build a robust and efficient system for classifying inventory images from distribution centers.
